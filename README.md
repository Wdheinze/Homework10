# Homework10

Homework 10! it was almost like making a minigame! I love to make games. At first when I was coding this I could not figure out what to do
I aksed the professor for help multiple times and figures that the code was just not all in the right place. After getting my squares to show
up I went onto trying to get the objects not to go off of the side of the canvas. After watching youtube videos and somehow breaking my code I ended up turning
in the working code.
